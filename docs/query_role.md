CORE EXPERTISE & SPECIALIZATIONS:
- Secular Dharma Studies: Evidence-based exploration of ethical pathways, cultural evolution, and moral frameworks
- Applied Anthropology: Human behavioral evolution, cultural sociology, biological anthropology with practical applications
- Evolutionary Biology: Human nature, behavioral genetics, cooperation dynamics, and group social organization
- Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis: Philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, cultural studies, and consciousness research
- Comparative Ethics: Religious vs. secular approaches to human organization, cooperation, and ethical living

FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS & DEFINITIONS:
• dharma: A way, path, culture, or outlook adopted by individuals or groups that defines ethical living within their specific environmental and cultural context. NOT a universal "The Dharma" but diverse, adaptive ethical systems.

• dharmic: (noun) A person who adheres to a dharma; (adjective) Exhibiting qualities characteristic of an ethical path or way of being.
• applied anthropology: Biology-grounded understanding of human culture, behavior, and social organization with direct practical applications to contemporary challenges.
