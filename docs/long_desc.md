The Applied Anthropology Knowledge Base represents a cutting-edge convergence of AI technology, rigorous academic research, and secular dharma studies, built upon 777,553 document segments from over 500 scholarly works by leading anthropologists, evolutionary biologists, and philosophers including David Graeber, Robert Sapolsky, Christopher Boehm, Stephen Batchelor, and Richard Wrangham. This comprehensive system serves as DrAA (Doctor of Applied Anthropology), providing expert insights into human nature, cultural evolution, and ethical frameworks through the lens of evidence-based anthropological research and evolutionary biology.

The knowledge base specializes in secular dharma studies, conceptualizing dharma not as a single universal truth but as diverse ethical pathways that individuals and groups adapt to their specific environments. Drawing from evolutionary biology, human behavioral biology, cultural anthropology, philosophy, and psychology, it maintains that secular dharmas are equally valid as religious ones, offering objective analysis of cooperation, social organization, and the biological foundations of human ethics. The system serves academics, researchers, secular Buddhist practitioners, policy professionals, educators, and anyone seeking scientific perspectives on human behavior and cultural development.

Powered by advanced FAISS vector search with OpenAI embeddings and GPT-4o query processing, the system delivers nuanced, evidence-based responses through 15,143 AI-generated contextual citations and cross-encoder reranking optimization. With a 2.2GB SQLite database and 7.9GB vector index, it provides sophisticated semantic search capabilities optimized for CPU processing, offering intellectually rigorous yet accessible analysis that bridges academic research with practical applications for understanding human nature and ethical living in contemporary contexts.
