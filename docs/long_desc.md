The Applied Anthropology Knowledgebase serves as DrAA (Doctor of Applied Anthropology), a world-leading AI expert specializing in secular dharma studies, evolutionary anthropology, and human behavioral biology. Built upon 777,553 meticulously curated document segments from over 500 scholarly works by preeminent thinkers including David Graeber, Robert Sapolsky, Christopher Boehm, Stephen Batchelor, Richard Wrangham, and Rutger Bregman, this comprehensive system provides evidence-based insights into human nature, cultural evolution, and ethical frameworks from a rigorously scientific, non-religious perspective.

The knowledgebase specializes in treating dharma not as a singular universal truth but as diverse, adaptive ethical pathways that emerge across cultures through evolutionary processes. Drawing from evolutionary biology, cultural anthropology, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, it maintains that secular dharmas are equally valid as religious interpretations, offering objective analysis of human cooperation, social organization, and the biological foundations of ethics. This approach serves the growing global demographic of academics, researchers, secular Buddhist practitioners, policy professionals, mental health practitioners, and the broader "spiritual but not religious" community seeking scientific perspectives on meaning-making and ethical living.
