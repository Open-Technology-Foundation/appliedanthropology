# .gitcommit Script Improvements

## Overview
The new `.gitcommit.new` script is a complete rewrite that adds numerous features and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

## New Features

### 1. Command-Line Options
- `-b, --bump TYPE` - Integrate with version.sh to bump version (major|minor|patch)
- `-n, --no-cleanup` - Skip running the cleanup utility
- `-t, --no-tests` - Skip test query verification
- `-d, --dry-run` - Preview what would happen without making changes
- `-h, --help` - Show comprehensive help

### 2. Enhanced Output
- Color-coded messages (INFO, SUCCESS, WARN, ERROR)
- Progress indicators for each step
- Summary of actions at completion
- Dry-run mode to preview changes

### 3. Version Management Integration
```bash
# Automatically bump version and commit
./.gitcommit -b patch "Fix critical bug"

# Bump minor version with auto-generated message
./.gitcommit -b minor
```

### 4. Safety Features
- Check if actually in a git repository
- Verify changes exist before attempting commit
- Show what will be committed before staging
- Test query validation (optional)
- Better error handling throughout

### 5. Git Operations
- Push both commits AND tags (original only pushed commits)
- Handle current branch properly
- Show staged changes before commit
- Check if tag already exists before creating

### 6. Improved Error Handling
- Proper exit codes
- Informative error messages
- Graceful handling of missing components
- Timeout on test queries

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Simple commit with auto-message
./.gitcommit

# Commit with custom message
./.gitcommit "Add new feature X"

# Bump patch version and commit
./.gitcommit -b patch "Fix issue #123"

# Dry run to see what would happen
./.gitcommit -d

# Skip cleanup and tests for quick commit
./.gitcommit -n -t "WIP: temporary commit"

# Bump minor version with full process
./.gitcommit -b minor "Add semantic search feature"
```

## Key Improvements Over Original

1. **Better Git Integration**
   - Original: Only `git push`
   - New: `git push origin <branch>` and `git push origin --tags`

2. **Version Management**
   - Original: Read-only version usage
   - New: Full integration with version.sh for bumping

3. **Error Handling**
   - Original: Basic error handling
   - New: Comprehensive error checking at each step

4. **User Feedback**
   - Original: Minimal output
   - New: Detailed, color-coded progress updates

5. **Flexibility**
   - Original: No options
   - New: Multiple command-line options for different workflows

6. **Testing**
   - Original: No validation
   - New: Optional test query to verify build integrity

## Migration Guide

To replace the old script:
```bash
# Backup original
mv .gitcommit .gitcommit.old

# Use new version
mv .gitcommit.new .gitcommit

# Or test side-by-side
./.gitcommit.new -d  # Dry run with new script
```

The new script is fully backward compatible:
- `./.gitcommit` still works exactly as before
- `./.gitcommit "message"` still works
- All new features are optional

## Technical Details

- **Lines of Code**: 261 (vs 37 original)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive
- **Dependencies**: Same as original (git, optionally cln and customkb)
- **Shell Compatibility**: Bash 4.0+
- **Exit Codes**: Properly defined (0=success, 1=error)

## Recommendations

1. Test the new script with dry-run mode first
2. Consider adding to git hooks for automated version bumping
3. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
4. Add to project documentation

The new script provides a much more robust and feature-rich git workflow while maintaining the simplicity of the original for basic use cases.
